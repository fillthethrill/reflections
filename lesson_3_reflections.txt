When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create remote repositories if you are working in a group from different computers. This will allow multiple people to contribute to the same project simultaneously.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you can control what gets pulled on your own. If someone has commmited something to the remote from somewhere else, you may not want it locally.
