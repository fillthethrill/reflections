When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create remote repositories if you are working in a group from different computers. This will allow multiple people to contribute to the same project simultaneously.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you can control what gets pulled on your own. If someone has commmited something to the remote from somewhere else, you may not want it locally.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are only use on GitHub, when you want to work on something that someone else's repository online. A clone is used either locally or online. You can clone a repository from Github to your computer if you want to work on it locally. A branch is deviation from the master, a duplicate of the code to be worked on independently of progress happening in the master version.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that you are working on the most up to date verison of your code locally.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be much harder. You would have to use DropBox or some form of google docs file sharing, but wouldn't necessarily have the revision control.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

IF you aren't sure whether you want the chagnes to be committed permanently.
