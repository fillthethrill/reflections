\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
\b0 \
It creates a .git folder to store all the meta data and revisions of the files in that repository.\

\b How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
\b0 \
The staging area is where you move files that you wish to add to a repository from a working directory. It is an intermediate step which allows you to control what/how is moved to the repository as well as add pertinent messages to the commits.}
